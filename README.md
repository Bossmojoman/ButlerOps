[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jasperproject/jasper-client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jasperproject/jasper-client) [![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/jasperproject/jasper-client.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/jasperproject/jasper-client) [![Codacy Badge](https://www.codacy.com/project/badge/3a50e1bc2261419894d76b7e2c1ac694)](https://www.codacy.com/app/jasperproject/jasper-client)

Client scripts and modifications built on top of the Jasper voice computing platform. Jasper is an open source platform for developing always-on, voice-controlled applications.

## PLEASE NOTE
This is in really rough shape currently as it was built as a quick POC for a blog post.  I'll be updating and refactoring it soon.
